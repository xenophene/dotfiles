My dofiles for vim. Includes some awesome features!
===

Installation: Just download into your $HOME folder and enjoy!

Key features:
----
- `jj` to Escape into Command mode. No more reaching out to the Esc key!
This combination takes some getting used to, but once there, you will find
your middle-finder constantly on j.

- autochdir: Changes dir automatically when opening an additional file
in vertical(vs) or horizontal(sp) split. Very handy and gives vim an 
Emacs feel to it.

- Code formatting for languages like Python, Html (Zencoding) enabled!

- Insert a single character: My most used feature. How many times do you
miss out that single `s` at the end of the word? From Command mode,
hit spacebar, and then a single character can be added before the 
character on which the cursor was originally. Extremely useful 
when you edit profusely.

Treat this as only a boilerplate, a lot many killer vim config files are
available out there. Start from this, and make something awesome of your
own.
